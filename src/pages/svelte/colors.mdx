# Colors

## Primary Color

Colors in Konsta UI are a bit tricky, because for example "Material You" design comes with whole set of different colors.

Konsta UI generate all required colors automatically, based on colors provided in `@theme` declaration.

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
@import 'konsta/react/theme.css';

@theme {
  --color-brand-primary: #007aff;
}
```

<div class="important-note">
  <p>
    It's important to note that color variable should start with{' '}
    <code>--color-brand-</code> prefix.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only colors defined with <code>--color-brand-</code> will be used for Konsta
    UI components theming.
  </p>
</div>

## Secondary Colors

If you want some secondary colors for Konsta UI components, let's say to make some button red, you need to specify these colors in same `@theme` declaration:

```css
@theme {
  --color-brand-primary: #007aff;
  --color-brand-red: #ff0000;
  --color-brand-green: #00ff00;
}
```

And to apply these colors, we need to add `k-color-[name]` class to required component, e.g.:

```jsx
<Button>Usual Button</Button>
<Button class="k-color-brand-red">Red Button</Button>
<Button class="k-color-brand-green">Green Button</Button>
```

Such colors will be correctly inherited, so `k-color-[name]` class can be added to parent elements as well, e.g.:

```jsx
<Page class="k-color-brand-red">
  <Button>Red Button</Button>
  <Button>Red Button</Button>
  <Button>Red Button</Button>
</Page>
```

## Material Color Schemes

There are 2 new additional color schemes for Material Design, you can use them by adding additional class to wrapping elements (e.g. `<html>` or `<body>`):

- **Monochrome Scheme** - by adding `k-md-monochrome` class,
- **Vibrant Scheme** - by adding `k-md-vibrant` class

These schemes are available only for Material Design, so if you are using iOS or Android Design, these classes will be ignored.
