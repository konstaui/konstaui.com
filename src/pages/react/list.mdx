# List React Component

List views are versatile and powerful user interface components frequently found in apps. A list view presents data in a scrollable list of multiple rows that may be divided into sections/groups.

List views have many purposes:

- To let users navigate through hierarchically structured data
- To present an indexed list of items
- To display detail information and controls in visually distinct groupings
- To present a selectable list of options
